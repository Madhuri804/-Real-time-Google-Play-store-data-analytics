# Real-time-Google-Play-store-data-analytics
The Google Play Store Analytics project is an in-depth exploration and analysis of the vast amount of data available on the Google Play Store. This project aims to derive meaningful insights from app data, including ratings, reviews, downloads, and more, to help understand trends, user preferences, and app performance.

3This bubble chart visualizes the relationship between app size (MB) and average rating for Games in the Google Play Store dataset. The bubble size represents the number of installs, helping analyze user preferences.

Visualization
1.Smaller-sized games (10-50 MB) tend to have higher ratings.
2.Larger apps (above 50 MB) have mixed ratings, possibly due to performance issues or high storage usage.
3.Bubble size variations suggest that install counts do not directly correlate with app size.
